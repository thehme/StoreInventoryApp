# Store Inventory App

This app allows a book store to keep track of its inventory of products. In the first phase of this project, the app stores dummy information about the a book and allows the user to see information about these dummy data entries in the app. In the second phase, this app will allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more books from the listed supplier.
